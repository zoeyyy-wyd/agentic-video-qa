# GRPO Stage-2 (plan §5) — Qwen3-VL-4B + LoRA + crop_video multi-turn, 1x A100 80GB.
# QA-reworked 2026-08-26: data from extract_rl.py, reward = compute_score_qa.
# Round 2 defaults since 2026-09-01: reward = compute_score_qa2 (IoU weight
# 1.0), R_acc instrument = judge v2 (JUDGE_V=2), lr schedule = constant,
# EXP_NAME = grpo_v2 -> results/grpo-v2/. Round 1 is reproduced by setting all
# four back explicitly (see "Round 1 reproduction" below); the two are NOT
# comparable if only some of them are.
#
# Every non-default key below was verified against verl 0.9.0 source:
# - rollout.mode=async + data.return_raw_chat=True    -> agent-loop path (docs/start/agentic_rl.rst)
# - agent.default_agent_loop=tool_agent               -> rows also carry agent_name="tool_agent"
# - multi_turn.tool_config_path                       -> crop_video_tool.yaml (CropVideoTool)
# - rollout.load_format=safetensors + lora_rank>0     -> LoRA-RL contract (docs/advance/ppo_lora.rst)
# - fsdp_config.*_offload=False                       -> a SPEED choice, not a memory fix.
#   param_offload exists for full-parameter finetuning, where params+grads+Adam
#   states cannot coexist with vLLM. With LoRA only the adapter is trainable
#   (126 MiB of weights, 265 MiB of optimizer state), so resident need is ~18G
#   against the 80-52=28G that survives vLLM waking up. Measured 2026-08-27:
#   785 s/step vs 876 s with offload on -- 91 s/step, ~6.7 h over 267 steps,
#   from not shuttling 35 G of params across PCIe twice per step.
#   It barely moves host RAM (peak 171 vs 175 G): the CPU-side WorkerDict
#   footprint is FSDP scaffolding, not the parked params. Cost is VRAM
#   headroom, 23 G -> 6.5 G, spent at the weight-sync instant (73.5/80 G,
#   identical on all 4 measured steps -- deterministic, not load-dependent).
#   If that is too thin: gpu_memory_utilization=0.55 buys back ~8 G.
# - actor.use_kl_loss=True (NOT algorithm.use_kl_in_reward) -> the GRPO paper puts
#   KL in the loss, not in the reward; mixing it into the reward would also
#   corrupt the reward numbers we report. Free here: lora_rank>0 makes verl set
#   ref_in_actor (ray_trainer.py:360), so the reference policy is this same
#   actor with the adapter switched off -- no second worker, no extra VRAM.
# - exclude_modules '.*visual.*'                      -> keep the ViT frozen; LoRA on the LLM only
# - max_user_turns=3 / max_assistant_turns=4          -> T=3 tool calls + final answer
# - limit_images=112                                  -> vLLM mm budget: 3 crops x 30 frames + slack
# - engine_kwargs.vllm.mm_processor_kwargs            -> cap profiling dummy images at the real crop
#   .max_pixels=150528                                   size; without it vLLM profiles 112 images at
#                                                        the preprocessor default 16.7M px and eats
#                                                        the whole KV pool (FRAMES_SWEEP.md §5)
# - data.val_batch_size=2                             -> loader batch, NOT a row cap:
#   all 114 val rows still run, two at a time. The val at test_freq=20 fires with
#   the training state resident (actor + optimizer + vLLM), which is where the
#   2026-08-26 c30 smoke lost a DataLoader worker to `signal: Killed`; unset, the
#   loader takes all 114 in one bite. A val_only pass over 114 is fine on its own
#   (measured the same day), so this is about the in-training slot.
#   Deliberately NOT capping rows with val_max_samples: it would buy ~1.2h of a ~60h run
#   and silently make every val_only run a subset of the val set.
# - max_actor_ckpt_to_keep, NOT max_ckpt_to_keep    -> the SFT trainer reads
#   `trainer.max_ckpt_to_keep`; the PPO trainer reads `max_actor_ckpt_to_keep`
#   / `max_critic_ckpt_to_keep` (ray_trainer.py:1006). Copying the SFT name
#   over cost a run on 2026-08-27: Hydra's `+` happily created the key, nothing
#   read it, and two 17G checkpoints piled up until / hit 93%. Wrong-but-legal
#   config keys fail silently -- verify with `ls results/<run>/ckpt` after the
#   second save, not by reading the override list.
# - trainer.use_v1=False                              -> V1 TaskRunner imports `transfer_queue`,
#                                                       which the verl 0.9.0 wheel neither ships nor
#                                                       declares as a dep (ENVIRONMENT.md §8)
# - rollout.max_model_len=prompt+response             -> left unset it falls back to
#                                                       max_position_embeddings=262144, whose single-
#                                                       sequence KV (~36G) exceeds the 0.45-util KV
#                                                       pool -> vLLM refuses to init (ENVIRONMENT.md §8)

TRAIN_BS=${TRAIN_BS:-8}

# lr: **constant 1e-5 since round 2** (GRPO2_PLAN §3c). Round 1 used cosine
# decay to 0.1x over TOTAL_STEPS and plateaued from step 180, exactly where lr
# had fallen below ~3e-6 -- the schedule froze learning in the phase the new
# reward terms most need it. The 2026-09-01 oscillation analysis (§2) showed
# the decay bought no stability either: lr fell 8x across the run while the
# sawtooth amplitude grew 0.113 -> 0.176, tracking the between-prompt
# difficulty spread, not the step size. verl's default is `constant` and RL
# usually keeps it flat because the policy -- and therefore the objective --
# moves under the optimizer, so "anneal toward a fixed optimum" does not
# strictly apply. Side benefit: TOTAL_STEPS stops being a schedule denominator,
# so extending or stopping early no longer bends the curve (the round-1 resume
# footgun below disappears). Collapse fallback (entropy falling fast +
# grad_norm rising, GRPO_NOTES §4): resume with
# `...lr_scheduler_type=cosine ...min_lr_ratio=0.3`.
#
# The cosine reasoning below is kept for the round-1 record; min_lr_ratio is
# inert under a constant schedule.
# Two things followed from choosing cosine:
#   - TOTAL_STEPS is now part of the schedule, not just a stopping point.
#     Changing it reshapes the whole curve, and resuming a run under a
#     different TOTAL_STEPS makes the lr jump rather than continue.
#   - min_lr_ratio=0.1 keeps a floor. At the default 0.0 the lr reaches
#     exactly 0 at the last step, so a run that goes the distance spends its
#     final steps not learning -- and this one is budgeted at ~60h, long
#     enough that being cut short is the likely outcome.
MAX_USER_TURNS=${MAX_USER_TURNS:-3}
# Horizon: EPOCHS, not a step count (round 2, 2026-09-01). verl derives
# total_training_steps = len(train_dataloader) * total_epochs whenever
# trainer.total_training_steps is null (ray_trainer.py:435), and the train
# loader is drop_last=True, so 1,068 rl_train prompts at batch 8 give
# floor(1068/8) = 133 steps/epoch -> EPOCHS=2 = 266 steps, ~60h at the
# measured 13.6 min/step. Round 1 hardcoded 267 for the same 2 epochs.
#
# Two reasons the epoch form is now the right one:
#   - the lr schedule is constant, so the horizon is no longer the denominator
#     of an anneal. Under round-1's cosine, changing the step count reshaped
#     the whole curve and a resume under a different value made lr JUMP; that
#     footgun is gone, and with it the reason to pin the number by hand.
#   - it tracks the data. Re-splitting SFT/RL (--sft-questions, DATA.md §3)
#     changes the prompt pool, and 2 epochs stays 2 epochs instead of silently
#     becoming 1.7 or 2.4 while the constant says 267.
# Headroom says there is something to find: at the SFT start the format term is
# already 0.487/0.5 but evidence_iou is 0.075/0.5, and the 3-step smoke moved
# reward 0.998 -> 1.165, so this is not a policy that saturates immediately.

#   pages once touched are never returned, so the ceiling IS the cost. Measured
#   2026-08-28: one step's DataProto is a single 16.5G object, /dev/shm high
#   water after 67 steps was 20G. Was 40G ("two generations with 2x margin");
#   that sizing turned every late ref-release into +16.5G of floor, permanently
#   -- the arena absorbed the overlap in RAM and never gave it back. Both OOM
#   kills (08-28 22:26 step ~122, 08-29 04:14 step ~141) were two such misses
#   plus one save/wake transient over the 95% line; per-step tokens/turns were
#   identical, so the miss rate is pure timing variance, not workload growth.
#   At 24G an overlap cannot be absorbed: Ray spills the old object to SSD
#   (~30s, roughly once per 20-60 steps) and the ceiling stops random-walking.
#   ray_init is **kwargs-forwarded to ray.init() (main_ppo.py:75); the key is
#   real (inspect.signature confirms). If it ever overflows the symptom is an
#   explicit ObjectStoreFullError, not a silent OOM.
#
# rollout_data_dir vs validation_data_dir: not interchangeable. The first is

# the second (:696), so a val_only run with just the first writes nothing.
#
# NB: never put a `#` comment between the backslash-continued lines of the
