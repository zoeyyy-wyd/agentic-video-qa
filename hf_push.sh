# Why the Hub rather than scp: this box has a 40 MB/s uplink and 3ms to HF, so
# the direct link is not what is slow -- scp is one TCP stream, and on a
# high-latency path one stream stalls on its window long before it saturates
# the line. The Hub's client opens many, and Xet chunks content so a re-run
# after a failure re-sends only what never landed.

# Put HF_TOKEN in .env, edit the two values below, then: bash hf_push.sh
# (add -y to skip the prompt)

set -euo pipefail

# HF_TOKEN comes from the repo-root .env (gitignored, chmod 600), not from a
# literal here: this script is tracked, so an earlier revision's hardcoded
# token went to GitHub with it and stayed live in the history.
#
# Same file and same precedence as agentic_tvg/judge.py::_load_dotenv -- a
# value already exported in the shell wins. One deliberate difference: an
# exported-but-empty var falls through to .env here, where judge.py would
# defer to it, because deferring turns a set-but-blank HF_TOKEN into a
# bare "HF_TOKEN is unset" that is very hard to read.
