"""Plot training curves from run_sft.sh console logs.

GRPO logs are a different shape -- 106 metrics per step instead of 10 -- and
have their own script, plot_grpo.py, which reuses parse()/write_csv() here.

Parses the trainer's per-step lines ("step:N - train/loss:... - ...") and
writes <log>.png next to each log. Metrics are also written as tensorboard
events (results/<run>/tb, see run_sft.sh) -- this script is the
no-server-needed complement for quick PNGs.

Usage:
    python plot_sft.py                     # newest logs/*.log with step lines
    python plot_sft.py results/sft-mix/console_*.log  # explicit log(s), one PNG each
    python plot_sft.py LOG -o results/sft-mix/curves.png   # explicit destination
    python plot_sft.py LOG --csv results/sft-mix/metrics.csv  # numbers, not pixels

A resumed run leaves one log per attempt. Concatenate them oldest-first for a
single whole-run curve -- repeated steps keep their LAST value, which is the
one that survived the rollback, so no hand-trimming is needed:

    python plot_sft.py results/sft-mix/console.log  # the trap-merged attempts

Token and memory metrics are written to `--csv` but get no panel -- the figure
is loss / lr / grad_norm / mfu. See NO_PANEL below for why.
